# audioVisualizerMIDI


Audio visualizer with a Chicago theme. Must use with a MIDI Controller Keyboard. 'Skyline' visual is based on the audio's amplitude. 'Sun' visual is based on the audio's frequency. Press any key on the MIDI Controller to generate stars on the screen. Click the screen to erase the stars. If 2 or more stars touch, confetti will appear and stars will be erased.
